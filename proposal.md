## SunPy

## Why did I choose this Project: SunPy?
I have been very interested in the Astrophysics and Cosmology domain for a long time. SunPy specifically
caught my eye due to my course, Intro. to Space Physics, which included a seminar on Sun-spots in which I
utilized SunPy to generate AIA and HMI Image of the Sun, thereby showing the correlation of sunspots and
magnetic field; I have been reading about SunPy since then, slowly learning about the incredible community.
I choosed this project since it brings out the best of both worlds, some Solar Physics and some Programming; for
me, it looked like a natural choice in my career to learn and hopefully contribute positively to the community;
more specifically, next subsection points to some reasons and benefits of such a project; of course, I’m open
to finding more in the future.

## Benefits of 3D Plotting in SunPy
- Super helpful when combining visualizations of multiple objects, for example combining HMI with AIA Image or adding a LASCO Map.
- Moreover, PFSSPy, a dependent of SunPy, which calculates the Potential-Field Source-surface model for
computing the coronal magnetic field features, has an exciting attribute, which can overlap field over the
image. One of the best use-cases of 3D plotting in SunPy.
- Suitable for intuitive understanding and visualization.
- Looks super cool.

## What have other people contributed to this project previously?

Presently, PR #4591 by Dr. David Stansby(@dstansby) provides a foundation for the project. It’s basically
a proof-of-concept; it takes a sunpy.map.Map object, converts it to Heliocentric-Inertial Coordinate system,
creates a mesh and finally plots in PyVista.

## My Contributions

<b>PR #5193</b>: Under Review <br>

- Adds support for file-handlers and file-type in Map and TimeSeries.
- <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5193">https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5193</a>

<b>Issue #3303</b>: Currently Working

- Create a Test or a function to report status on all remote servers SunPy pings during a test run.
- Thinking about using a pytest plugin, pytest-vcr, to intercept the requests with a flag, but its likely to change.

## Abstract
SunPy currently uses Matplotlib for plots and has limited support for 3D plots owing to PR #4591 .
The project’s goal is to pack PR #4591 into a new package, independent of SunPy, and develop a complete
API initially interfacing with PyVista but general enough for other backends like plotly too.
SunPy has excellent support for 2D plots with Matplotlib, but 3D support is missing; through 3D backing, one
can easily combine visualizations of multiple objects such as overlapping HMI on a AIA image in 3D; it’ll be a
gem for intuitiveness. Moreover, PFSSPy, a dependent package of SunPy, which calculates the Potential-Field
Source-surface model for computing the coronal magnetic field features, has an exciting attribute, which can
overlap field over the image; this’ll precisely be the best use case for 3D support in SunPy. I believe the project
is evenly balanced between writing, testing and documenting code

## Goals
- Convert code from PR #4591 into a new package under SunPy org, and understand it down it a fiber.
- Add infrastructure to plot astropy coordinate object.
- Add infrastructure to support other data types, too, like for SOHO, RHESSI, etc.
- Hoping for 90%, targeting 100% code-coverage. Benchmarks and extra optimizations, if possible.
- Documentation for the whole project.

## Time Commitment

I plan to fully commit and immerse into the project, with a minimum investment of 20hr/week and with an
average of 25hr/week.
Honestly, I am not a big fan of assessing based on time investment; my priority would be to make and follow
weekly task schedules, with some buffer time for unforeseeable circumstances and additional tests.

## Timeline
I have attached a thorough timeline of the proposed project. Regarding my commitments, I’ll have my course
classes from August 10, so I’ve shifted some of the workload to July.
I plan to to publish a weekly blog for the project with all relevant details to help future developers and users; I
believe this would be critical in the long run.

- May 17, 2021 - May 24, 2021
    - Familiarize with the code and the community.
    - Since I am already familiar with the dev env and test systems used in SunPy so I’ll quickly go through it again just in-case, and will focus more on the code and how it all is integrated together.
    - Create a separate package with PR #4591 as foundation and set-up all necessary workflows.

- May 24, 2021 - June 1, 2021

## Probable Issues/Challenges

- The API will initially depend upon pyvista, which works on VTK, unfortunately Read the Docs doesn’t
support a headless-display, but this need to be investigated after reply from @cadair suggesting a possible
solution.
- As of now, whenever I run pyvista from Jupyter Notebook it bugs out crashing the notebook, I’m not sure
if this is a wide-spread or localised issue
