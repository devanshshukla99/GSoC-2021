\subsection{Project Abstract}
SunPy currently uses Matplotlib for plots and has limited support for 3D plots owing to \pr. 

The project's goal is to pack \pr into a new package, independent of SunPy, and develop a complete API initially interfacing with PyVista but general enough for other backends like plotly too. 
SunPy has excellent support for 2D plots with Matplotlib, but 3D support is missing; through 3D backing, one can easily combine visualizations of multiple objects such as overlapping HMI on a AIA image in 3D; it'll be a gem for intuitiveness. Moreover, PFSSPy, a dependent package of SunPy, which calculates the Potential-Field Source-surface model for computing the coronal magnetic field features, has an exciting attribute, which can overlap field over the image; this'll precisely be the best use case for 3D support in SunPy.
The project is evenly balanced between writing, testing and documenting code.

% It can be divided into five objectives,
% - Convert code from \pr into a new package under SunPy org, and understand it down it a fiber.
% - Add infrastructure to plot astropy coordinate object.
% - Add infrastructure to support other data types, too, like for SOHO, RHESSI, etc.
% - Hoping for 90\%, targeting 100\% code-coverage. Benchmarks and extra optimizations, if possible.
% - Complete documentation
