\subsection{Time Commitment}
    % I plan to commit and immerse fully into the project, with a minimum investment of 20hr/week to a maximum of 35hr/week and an average of 30hr/week.
    % Honestly, I am not a big fan of assesing based on time-investment, my first priority would be to make and follow weekly task schedules, with some buffer time for unforeseeable circumstances and additional tests.
