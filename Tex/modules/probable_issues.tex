        \item The API will initially depend upon pyvista, which works on VTK, unfortunately Read the Docs doesn't support a headless-display, but this need to be investigated after reply from @cadair \href{https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4591#issuecomment-749542653}{suggesting a possible solution}.
        \item As of now, whenever I run pyvista from Jupyter Notebook it bugs out crashing the notebook, I'm not sure if this is a wide-spread or localised issue.
