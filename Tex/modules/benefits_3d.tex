    \begin{focus}
        % \item Super useful when combining visualizations of multiple objects, for example combining HMI with AIA Image or adding a LASCO Map.
        % \item For Example, PFSSPy, a dependent of SunPy, has a feature of overplotting field lines over an AIA Map, such a feature would be benefited a lot if there is 3D plot support in SunPy. (\autoref{fig:pfsspy}).
        % \item Good for intuitive understanding and visualization.
        % \item Looks super cool.
        \item Super helpful when combining visualizations of multiple objects, for example combining HMI with AIAImage or adding a LASCO Map.
        \item For Example, PFSSPy, a dependent of SunPy, has a feature of overplotting field lines over an AIA Map; it has an exciting attribute, which can overlap field over the image; this will precisely be the best use case for 3D support in SunPy.  (Figure 2).
        \item Suitable for intuitive understanding and visualization.
        \item Looks super cool.
