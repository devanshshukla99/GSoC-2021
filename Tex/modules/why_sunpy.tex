\subsection{Why did I choose this Project: SunPy?}
    I have been very interested in the AstroPhysics and Cosmology domain, but SunPy specifically caught my eye due to one of my course, \textit{Into. to Space Physics}, which included a seminar on Sun-spots in which I utilized SunPy to generate AIA and HMI Image of the Sun, thus showing the correlation of sunspots and magnetic field;
    I have been reading about SunPy since then, slowly learning about the awesome community.

    This project brings out the best of both worlds, some Solar Physics and some Programming; for me it looked like a natural choice in my career to learn and hopefully contribute positively to the community.

    More specifically, \autoref{sec:benefits_of_3d_plot} points to some benefits of 3D plotting I could see, ofcourse I'm open to find more in the future.

    I will to contribute to SunPy even if I am not accepted, though I would prefer otherwise.
