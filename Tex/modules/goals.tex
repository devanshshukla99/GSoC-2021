\subsubsection{Goals}
    % The goal of the project is to throw \pr into a new package and develop an API intially using pyvista but general enough for other backends like plotly.
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Convert code from \pr into a new package under SunPy org.
    %     \item Hoping for 90\%, targeting 100\% code-coverage.
    %     \item Add documentation.
    %     \item Add infrastructure to plot astropy coordinate object.
    %     \item Add infrastructure to support other data types too.
    % \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convert code from \pr into a new package under SunPy org, and understand it down it a fiber.
    \item Add infrastructure to plot astropy coordinate object.
    \item Add infrastructure to support other data types, too, like for SOHO, RHESSI, etc.
    \item Hoping for 90\%, targeting 100\% code-coverage. Benchmarks and extra optimizations, if possible.
    \item Complete documentation
\end{itemize}

In all, we have to prepare a pre-release of the package for 3D support.
