\subsection{Goals}
    The goal of the project is to throw \pr into a new package and develop an API intially using pyvista but general enough for other backends like plotly.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert code from \pr into a new package under SunPy org.
        \item Hoping for 90\%, targeting 100\% code-coverage.
        \item Add documentation.
        \item Add infrastructure to plot astropy coordinate object.
        \item Add infrastructure to support other data types too.
    \end{itemize}
